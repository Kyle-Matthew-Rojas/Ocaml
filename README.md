# Assignment 3 & 4

## Description
Complete the OCaml functions in the provided file

### Directions for Assignments

- In coding your functions, you may only use what you have learned so far in this course – you are NOT
allowed to use OCaml’s pattern matching for this assignment. Using any other language features of
OCaml will result in no credit for a given problem.
- For your convenience, the types of the functions are already specified for you. Do NOT change problem
descriptions, function names, parameter names and parameter types. Also, do not reorder the original
problem descriptions and function definitions.
- The shell file contains placeholders (see below) that indicate where you fill in your code. Do not make
any changes to the shell file except the placeholders. You must use the shell file for this assignment.
